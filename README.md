### 1. Ontology

The ontology is stored in the "Ontology" folder, which contains the following:

- **SemSEX.ttl**: This Turtle file represents the sexual education ontology, capturing various concepts related to the subject.

- **docs**: The docs directory contains the documentation of the ontology in the html format. The main file is index.html.

### 2. Concept Detection

The "Concept-Detection" folder contains machine learning models for detecting concepts defined in the ontology. Each model is stored as an individual file:

- **Curriculum documents**: Contains raw documents with description of curriculums. The documents are annotated with concepts from the ontology.
- **dataset_preparation**: Contains python code for converting the raw pdf documents into pandas dataframes that can be used for training the classifiers. 
- **Classifiers**: Contains classifiers written in python for automatically detecting concepts from sexual education.
- **common.py**: A helper file containing functions useful across other documents
- **README.md**: Instructions for running the classifiers and the description of their results.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of required python packages.

Feel free to explore and use these models for concept detection based on the sexual education ontology.
