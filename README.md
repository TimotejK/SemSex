### 1. Ontology

The ontology is stored in the "Ontology" folder, which contains the following:

- **SemSEX.ttl**: This Turtle file represents the sexual education ontology, capturing various concepts related to the subject.

- **docs**: The docs directory contains the documentation of the ontology in the html format. The main file is index.html.

### 2. Concept Detection

The "Concept-Detection" folder contains machine learning models for detecting concepts defined in the ontology. Each model is stored as an individual file:

- **model_1.h5**
- **model_2.h5**
- **model_3.h5**

Feel free to explore and use these models for concept detection based on the sexual education ontology.

### 3. README.md
